Abstract
--------
This study investigates the relationship between collaborative communication patterns and academic performance using WhatsApp group chat data from student teams working on university projects. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and statistical methods, we analyze features such as sentiment, participation equality, dialogue acts, and topic modeling to assess their predictive power for final grades. Our findings indicate that communication styles, emotional tone, and structural engagement play a significant role in team performance.
